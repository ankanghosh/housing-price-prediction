# housing-price-prediction
# About the project
Basic housing price prediction using a dataset from Kaggle.
This is a Google Colab notebook to predict housing prices using a Kaggle dataset. The data is first cleaned and normalized and a Deep Neural Networks (DNN) is used to implement regression for predicting the housing prices.

# Tools Used
Tools and libraries used in this project include TensorFlow, Keras, pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and seaborn.

# Who can benefit from the project?
Anyone can use the project to get started with the basics of regression and TensorFlow.

# Getting Started
Anyone interested in getting started with Machine Learning or Deep Learning, specifically, regression using TensorFlow and DNNs, can clone or download the project to get started.

# References
The most important point of reference for the project is the TensorFlow tutorial on using regression to predict fuel efficiency. Link [here](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/keras/regression).

# Additional Notes
1. The dataset is currently not available, but was available on Kaggle in the past. Please feel free to reach out to me at ankanatwork@gmail.com if you would like to learn more about the dataset. However, I may not be able to share the dataset with you due to licensing restrictions.
2. The project is a basic one in nature and is not currently being maintained.
